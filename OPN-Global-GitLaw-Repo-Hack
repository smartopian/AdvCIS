## OPN-Ctrl- International GitLaw Repo-Proposal

This is apart of a long term multi-standard community initiatives and 20 years of OECD to ISO standardisation for cross border data governance.

This is the first hack for aNG for international policy infrastructure and is apart of a long term series of community projects that has driven the development of decentralised notice and consent standards and best practice for identity management and surveillance technology. Designed to enhance privacy policies and Terms of Use in a way that addressess the #FakePrivacy burden of policy.

After a decade of standards development the next generation privacy standard for Online Notice has been published.   standard for Operational Notice & Consent Receipts has been published June 2020 (ISO 29184 with the Notice & Consent Receipt) which we can finally put to good use.

Challenge 1: Write a standard contractual clause to supersede terms of online services for Data Rights which mandate consistent control performance, consider key issues (and well know problems)

Privacy Rights - Consent Types for Master Data Controls https://openconsent.atlassian.net/l/c/Gw2dCTwL

review the Privacy rights, Consent Type and legal justification obligations and consideration

use this material to draft standard clauses for the use of privacy rights for data controls.

Publish Clause to AdvCIS or to GitHub

Objective is to make standard clauses for the International Repository - which supersede terms of service and provide data subject with master privacy data controls.

To use the newly published (and long awaited) ISO Online Privacy Notice Controls combined into the Kantara / AdvCIS: Operational Notice & Consent Receipt Specification V1.2, which provide an independent inter-national legal toolset for decentralised transparency and data control.  To put this resource to use it requires first the extra-territorial space and the formation of standardised contractual clauses as an alternative to what we have now.

This approach to developing standard clauses for gitlaw aims to  begin this clause repository collaboratively together.  Using Common Accord so that clauses can be iterated upon through application, (reused rather than re-issued.)  With international transborder security and privacy rights so that all stakeholders can use the same standards to be interoperable with humans. In essence the evolution of a very old human innovation called the receipt.  

Why an International GitLaw Repository
- The objective of this hackathon is to further international computational law by creating and working on standard privacy contract clauses for extending privacy rights for transborder data flows to contracts and terms and services. Cross legal jurisdiction and identity surveillance domains with Master Data Right Controls.
   - What will this accomplish:
   - Support international Operational Privacy Rights and Enforcement Perspective

 Method - Go through modularity - clause then reference the same  clause - modularity
- post publicly - internationally

## Background:

To address these data governance challenges there has been a long term year effort to standardise guidelines for transborder flows of personal data for online identification and personal data management. In this regard the international standard for Online Privacy and Consent Controls is recently published - with the use of receipt standard to capture privacy records from online privacy notice and consent.

Privacy policies and terms of use that people are suppose to read and learn have been show to be the Biggest Lie on The Internet, rather than notice and consent, online services are governed by terms of services and online privacy policy regardless of the physical context, in which the person / "user" is expected to read and understand this policies. Each service having its own policy and terms. An issue dogged by the movies like "terms and conditions may apply", "the greatest hack", and the. "social dilemma" these policies and terms are contracts of adhesion dressed up as consent. Without transparent security, strong (or better legal transparency), meaningful notice and proportional use of rights.

Key Points Standard Clause should be aware of

Surveillance by Design - Online surveillance dark patterns in consent and notice put people at risk of harms in an increasing number of ways as the power of big data technology grows. These dark patterns, also known as surveillance by design makes explicit consent for special/sensitive data categories low quality. Especially if consent is 100% dependent on online privacy Notice.

Strong transparency is missing for digital services - little transparency over the legal entities and privacy risks and

Key Risks over the use of Digital Identity Management

### Meta-Data - Identifier Management Transparency (IMT) this is critical component of any clause. (e.g. restricting identification or identifiers tracking, cross-site profiling, with cookies and beacons. Especially for data trusts like parental consent, or for medical research, etc which require consent by design, where metadata and big data is a human resource (not a capitalistic one)

### Secondary Use

Surveillance before explicit consent to surveillance (when consent is lawfully required) is not meaningful consent and is un-trustworthy. In most contexts this is considered a breach of security as notice and consent is required for lawful data processing (with some exceptions)
Secondary Use of Data - for example - context based advertising - without context based privacy safeguards - write a privacy agreement clause for restricting secondary use of data for advertising

Transparency over 3rd Party disclosures and beneficial owners of data processing (e.g. 2nd party Controller or 3rd party is explicit) are provided with a short linked notice receipt to the original Notice for a record of data processing.

Core example: For data trusts or self sovereign - master data control management the meta-data and big data benefits are under a fiduciary trust. (like children's education records), Privacy information should be automatically sourced, meta-data, secondary use of data, the source of the data and data inferred produced by the system.
